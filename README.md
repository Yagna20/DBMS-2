# DBMS-2
This project intends to modify the data of 636k books worth of data given in a specific way and store it in a database. 

To do so, open PostgreSQL, run the code.py in VS-Code to obtain PAPERS.sql.

If you want to run your own input, create a new text file and rename the input file in code.py

Then run loader.sql and PAPERS.sql in PostgreSQL and you will have a database.
